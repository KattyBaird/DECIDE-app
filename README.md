# DECIDE app

This repository does not store the code for the DECIDE 
app - that is stored in a CEH GitLab repository from where it 
can be deployed to our Kubernetes clusters. The aim of this repository
is to provide a publicly accessible issue tracker for the app.

We will also use milestones to assign particular issues and tasks
to particular releases of the app.
