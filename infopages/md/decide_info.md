## Welcome to the DECIDE project – recording nature where it matters

Recording wildlife provides valuable information on where species are and how they are doing.  

Every wildlife record is useful and helps us to improve our knowledge of wildlife, but some records are especially valuable. This is because there is less good information for some species from some places, even though we have great information on others. 

DECIDE is a new project helping wildlife recorders to identify the places where contributing new wildlife records will be of greatest value to conservation. We have an interactive online Tool which will allow users to see which locations are most in need of new records. 

We would like you to be part of the development of this Tool. Through the coming summer we will be adding to the DECIDE Tool. Whether you are an experienced recorder, or are just starting out, we would love to hear your views. So, please explore this version of the Tool and tell us what you think!
