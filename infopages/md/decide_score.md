## What is the DECIDE score?

<img src="/infopages/images/score-image2.png" style="float:right; width: 400px; margin-left: 1em"/>The DECIDE score is a number, for any given 100 meter square (referred to below as 'cells'), that indicates the relative value of new records in that square in terms of improving the species distribution models that we use to monitor species.

There is no absolute meaning to any given score, they only have meaning relative to each other. So by comparing the scores of all the cells in a given area we can see where, among those cells, time spent recording is likely to generate most value.

In the current version of the app, DECIDE scores are displayed visually as a map within a five kilometre radius of a given point.

In the current version of the app, DECIDE scores are mapped for just two groups of species:
- all butterflies 
- all day-flying moths

So these maps show the relative values of cells for new records of butterflies and moths respectively, without saying anything about the relative value of records of different species within those groups. It is possible to generate DECIDE score maps for any group of species, or even individual species. Later versions of the app may provide more flexibility in this respect.

## How to generate a DECIDE score map

1. Centre the map on the area of interest. (If you want to use your current location, you can use the 'centre on current' location button.)
2. Click the 'DECIDE score' button.

- You can switch between the score maps for butterflies and moths by using the radio buttons in the side bar.
- You can use the 'fader' to fade the map in and out in order to view the basemap underneath.
- You can get information on access from the four access layers.
- Clicking on an access feature in the map may give you useful information about it.
- Access layers can be switched on and off using the toggle buttons in the side bar.
