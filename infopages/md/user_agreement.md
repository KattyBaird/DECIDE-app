## Summary 
- The DECIDE project seeks to support wildlife recorders. This is through a Tool providing information on where records are most needed. Part of the aim of this project is co-development: to improve and co-development of the Tool in response to feedback from users and development by the project team. 
- The DECIDE Tool operates on a 'freemium' model - anyone can use the tool without logging in. Users who register can choose how much information to share with the tool. Settings can be updated at any time. We recommend that users register to receive full functionality of future versions of the tool and opt in to receive communications. 

## Disclaimer
The information in this tool is advisory. Information is provided in good faith, but this should not be taken as a legal basis for right of access. In all circumstances. In all circumstances, it is the user's responsibility to prioritise their own health and safety.
## What you agree to if you contribute to DECIDE 
- If you contribute to the DECIDE project through use of the Tool, registering and providing feedback, you grant us and our collaborators permission to use your contributions to further the goal of supporting wildlife recorders in making valuable records of wildlife for use in monitoring and research. 
- We ask that you grant us these permissions because they allow us to respond to the changing situation of the Tool as it is developed through feedback from users, analysis of peopleâ€™s use of the Tool and members of the research team. 
- We also ask that you give us permission to relate your use of the Tool to publicly-available records that you have made in the past or will make via wildlife recording platforms such as iRecord and iSpot. Granting us permission to make this association is optional and can be withdrawn at any point by emailing decide@ceh.ac.uk. Any analysis will be used to evaluate the Tool and its application; all personal data will be anonymised prior to being shared with members of the Team and aggregated prior to publication. 
- You also have the opportunity to provide feedback to the Tool via a feedback form. This is entirely voluntary and any information you provide may be used to evaluate the Tool. 
- Any aspects of the evaluation that require ethical approval have received, or will gain, approval by The University of York Environment Department Research Ethics Committee.

- All your data will be kept confidentially, and access will be restricted to the evaluation team. Data shared within the team will be anonymised and so users will not be individually identifiable.
