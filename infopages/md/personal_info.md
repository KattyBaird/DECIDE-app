## Personal information strategy

The DECIDE app has the facility to store personal preferences for logged in users and, potentially, other information that tracks engagement with the app.

In the initial release of the app, you can login and record taxonomic preferences and also whether or not you are happy to let the app record your engagement with it. In the first release, logged in users can record this information:
- Full name
- Name you like to be known by
- Whether or not you are happy to let the app record your engagement with it
- Taxonomic preferences currently:
  - Butterflies
  - Moths
  - Grasshoppers & Crickets

In this first release, nothing is done with this information - it is there only to establish the facility for collecting it.
