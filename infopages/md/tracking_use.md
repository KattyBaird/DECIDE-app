## Tracking use of the app

The DECIDE app operates on a 'freemium' model - anyone can use the app without logging in. Users who register can 
[choose how much information to share](/info/personal_info) with the app. Settings can be updated at any time.

No personal data is collected from users who choose not to register or log in.

We use Google Anaytics to track use of the app. The only identification data sent to Google Anaytics is an IP address,
but we have enabled [IP Anonymization](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en) so 
the full IP address is never saved, meaning that individual users cannot be identified by this means.
