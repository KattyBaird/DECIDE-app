[//]: # (title: DECIDE Tool - more info)
## What is the idea of the DECIDE Tool? 

The DECIDE Tool shows where records are most needed based on comparing scores in different locations (100 x 100m grid squares) within a region (a 5km radius around your selected location). Rather than simply basing this on gaps in the distribution of records from the past, we have used statistical models to predict where species occur and used these to work out where records are most needed to improve their accuracy. For now we are focusing on butterflies and day-flying moths. 

## I’ve used the DECIDE Tool and chosen where to record. What now? 
Firstly, please give us feedback. And keep giving us more! You are now part of the DECIDE community, so we are developing this Tool with you and for you! We will be updating this Tool with new features, and in response to your feedback. 

Secondly, go out and look for wildlife in your chosen location! When making records, it is particularly valuable when you submit records for all the species that you observe for your chosen wildlife group (e.g. butterflies or day-flying moths) at that location, not just the special species. 

## Submitting wildlife records 
The DECIDE Tool is not used for recording because there are many excellent tools for making wildlife records. The [iRecord app](https://irecord.org.uk/app/) and [iRecord Butterflies app](https://butterfly-conservation.org/our-work/recording-and-monitoring/irecord-butterflies) makes recording easy when in the field but you can also send in records via the [iRecord website](https://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord/), [iSpot website](https://www.ispotnature.org/), or other routes such as your local county recorder, or your Local Environmental Records Centre. Records sent via any of these routes will end up being available for conservation use and to update the models in the DECIDE Tool.
