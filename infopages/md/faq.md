[//]: # (title: Frequently asked questions)
### How is it decided where new records are most needed?   
- For now in the DECIDE project, we are using existing records to predict the distribution of species for a 100m grid across the whole of Great Britain – these ‘species distribution models’ provide a prediction of the probability that the species is in a location and provide uncertainty of the prediction.  

- The places where records are most needed are the places where the predictive species distribution models have greatest uncertainty.   

- We combine these results across species to produce the DECIDE Score that is shown in the DECIDE Tool. 

- This means that the need for more records is not based on the number of existing records from that place, but whether it is valuable to gather more records from that place. This is a new way of thinking about wildlife recording.  

### Why do we use predictive models rather than simply asking people to record in places without records?   
- This is a good question. Lots of different types of people require good information about wildlife to make good decisions: such as conservation organisations, landowners, local councils or national government. Many people require information at fine resolution, which is why our maps are based on 100m grids, but they also need information that is comprehensive.  

- Because there are so many 100m grid squares in Britain (about 25 million!) we cannot simply visit every one to ‘fill the gaps’. We use statistical models to predict where the species are likely to occur. 

- Of course, people do use the actual records (the ‘raw data’). These are important, for instance to make good decisions about nature reserve management or taking into account the presence of protected species when planning developments.  

### Why can’t I submit wildlife records using the DECIDE tool? 
- There are many existing tools for wildlife recording and we did not want to add another one. Instead we recommend  

- If you want to make records with a smartphone app, then we recommend using the iRecord app or the iRecord Butterflies app. 

- You can also use websites such as iRecord or iSpot, or send your records to your local environmental records centre.  

 
### If I add new records how quickly will the DECIDE score change for that place? 
- Often records require checking before they become available for us to use, however we are working on methods to make the DECIDE Tool update as quickly as possible. 

### What is our vision for how the tool will develop?  
- Our aim is to make the data in this tool constantly updated so the places where records are most needed depends on the species of interest, the time of year they are likely to be seen, and whether people have recorded there recently. This is known as ‘adaptive sampling with citizen science’.  

- We are also exploring new ways of engaging with recorders using exciting new approaches such as automatically-generated text and personalised recommendations. Is this something that you would like? Make sure you register on the tool and you can contribute to the way that this part of the tool develops!  

### Why does the tool only work for butterflies and some moths?  
- In this stage of the project we are focussing on butterflies and day-flying moths, but we look forward to including more species groups in the future.  

### Who else is part of the team?  
- DECIDE is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and is a project led by UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, in collaboration with University of York, University of Warwick and the Open University, and in partnership with the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Butterfly Conservation, North and East Yorkshire Environmental Data Centre and Greenspace Infrastructure for Greater London.  

### And finally, does the name DECIDE stand for anything?  

- The overall project is to support wildlife recorders to DECIDE where to record, and to help decision-makers DECIDE how best to support nature. The full title of the project is Delivering Enhanced Biodiversity Information with adaptive Citizen Science and Intelligent Digital Engagements. You can see why we shorted it to DECIDE!
