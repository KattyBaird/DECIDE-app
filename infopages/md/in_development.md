## App development strategy

<img src="/infopages/images/roadworks.png" style="float:right; width:190px; margin-left: 1em"/>Development of the DECIDE web app is guided by an ongoing co-design process between the users in the community of biological recorders and the project team.  

It is envisaged that the app will develop and change rapidly over the course of the project. 

We hope that you have ideas on how the app could progress and improve, so please add your [feedback](https://ceh-online-surveys.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/decide_feedbackform_intool_general).
